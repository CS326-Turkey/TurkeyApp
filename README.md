# TurkeyApp
## Overview
Team Turkey presents Glean, a change to charity program that will help you feel that little goodness, those warm fuzzies for putting your money to good use.

You make a purchase, Glean rounds up the cost, subtracts the actual purchase from the cost, and that difference goes to a charity of your choice!

Glean does this by integrating into your bank account and keeping track of the charges you make. Itâ€™s easy, safe, and secure.
