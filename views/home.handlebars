        <p><font size="5">    Glean, a change to charity program that will help you feel that little goodness, those warm fuzzies for putting your money to good use. You make a purchase, Glean rounds up the cost, subtracts the actual purchase from the cost, and that difference goes to a charity of your choice! Glean does this by integrating into your bank account and keeping track of the charges you make. </font></p>

        <p><font size="5">Every time you makes a purchase, the difference in change to the nearest dollar is donated to a charity of choice. Glean takes away the hassles of dealing with change when balancing checkbooks, and helps anyone with credit or debit cards easily give to charities in need. These microdonations add up overtime, and Glean will elegantly present donations accumulated to better help you see the impact you are making.</font></p>
