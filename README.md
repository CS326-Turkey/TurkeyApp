# TurkeyApp

## Overview
Team Turkey presents Glean, a change to charity program that will help you feel that little goodness, those warm fuzzies for putting your money to good use.

You make a purchase, Glean rounds up the cost, subtracts the actual purchase from the cost, and that difference goes to a charity of your choice!

Glean does this by integrating into your bank account and keeping track of the charges you make. Itâ€™s easy, safe, and secure.

## How To Run

Aquire the credentials.js file for database authentication from an admin. Place this file in the main directory.

## Statefulness

There are three states: logged in as users, logged in as admin and non-logged in. When the user is non-logged in, he can only go to the regular homepage, team view, log in view, register view, forget password view and about view. When the user is logged in as a user, he can go to the views just mentioned plus dashboard view and profile view. When the user is logged in as an admin, he can go to the views for non-logged-in users plus admin view. 
There are two js files for routing. One is user-routes.js and the other is admin-routes.js. They are in the directory called routes. user-route.js handles the routes to the view only for users. admin-rount.js handles the routes to the view only for admin. There are also some route handling in app.js


[user-routes.js](routes/user-routes.js) , 
[admin-routes.js](routes/admin-routes.js) , 
[app.js](app.js)
